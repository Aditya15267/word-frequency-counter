word count from Wikipedia the free encyclopedia the word count is the number of words in a document or passage of text Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words This may particularly be the case in academia legalproceedings journalism and advertising Word count is commonly used by translators to determine the price forthe translation job Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of readability and to measure typingand reading speeds usually in words per minute When converting character counts to words a measure of five orsix characters to a word is generally used Contents Details and variations of definition Software In fictionIn non fiction See also References Sources External links Details and variations of definitionThis section does not cite any references or sources Please help improve this section by adding citations toreliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removedVariations in the operational definitions of how to count the words can occur namely what counts as a word andwhich words don't count toward the total However especially since the advent of widespread word processing thereis a broad consensus on these operational definitions and hence the bottom line integer resultThe consensus is to accept the text segmentation rules generally found in most word processing software including howword boundaries are determined which depends on how word dividers are defined The first trait of that definition is that a space any of various whitespacecharacters such as a regular word space an em space or a tab character is a word divider Usually a hyphen or a slash is tooDifferent word counting programs may give varying results depending on the text segmentation ruledetails and on whether words outside the main text such as footnotes endnotes or hidden text) are counted But the behaviorof most major word processing applications is broadly similar However during the era when school assignments were done inhandwriting or with typewriters the rules for these definitions often differed from todays consensusMost importantly many students were drilled on the rule that certain words don't count usually articles namely a an the butsometimes also others such as conjunctions for example and or but and some prepositions usually to of Hyphenated permanentcompounds such as follow up noun or long term adjective were counted as one word To save the time and effort of countingword by word often a rule of thumb for the average number of words per line was used such as 10 words per line These ruleshave fallen by the wayside in the word processing era the word count feature of such software which follows the textsegmentation rules mentioned earlier is now the standard arbiter because it is largely consistent across documents andapplications and because it is fast effortless and costless already included with the application As for which sections ofa document count toward the total such as footnotes endnotes abstracts reference lists and bibliographies tables figurecaptions hidden text the person in charge teacher client can define their choice and users students workers can simplyselect or exclude the elements accordingly and watch the word count automatically update Software Modern web browserssupport word counting via extensions via a JavaScript bookmarklet or a script that is hosted in a website Most wordprocessors can also count words Unix like systems include a program wc specifically for word countingAs explained earlier different word counting programs may give varying results depending on the text segmentation ruledetails The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement thus the variation is acceptableIn fiction Novelist Jane Smiley suggests that length is an important quality of the novel However novels can varytremendously in length Smiley lists novels as typically being between and words while National Novel Writing Monthrequires its novels to be at least words There are no firm rules for example the boundary between a novella and a novelis arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise But while the length of a novel is to a large extent upto its writer lengths may also vary by subgenre many chapter books for children start at a length of about words and atypical mystery novel might be in the to word range while a thriller could be over wordsThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies word lengths for each category of its Nebula award categoriesClassification	Word count Novel over words Novella to words Novelette to words Short story under wordsIn non fiction The acceptable length of an academic dissertation varies greatly dependent predominantly on the subjectNumerous American universities limit Ph.D. dissertations to at most words barring special permission for exceeding this limit
